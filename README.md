# Express.js Server Issues

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with Express.js servers: the server failing to start or respond to incoming requests.

The `bug.js` file contains code exhibiting this problem.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution and explanation.

## Possible Causes

* **Port Conflict:** Another application might already be using the specified port (3000 in this example).
* **Incorrect Server Setup:**  A misconfiguration in the Express.js setup could prevent the server from listening correctly.
* **Unhandled Exceptions:** An uncaught error during server initialization or request handling can cause the server to crash silently.
* **Missing Dependencies:** Ensure that you've installed all necessary packages using `npm install`.
